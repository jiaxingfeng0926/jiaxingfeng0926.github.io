**Inspiration to coding**

Growing up, my older sister was a huge inspiration to me. She majored in computer science and achieved success in her career, which left a deep impression on me. When I was still struggling with which major to choose, she encouraged me to give computer science a try as well. She knows that I like video games and passionate about creation. She believes that I will enjoy programming. Her support gave me the confidence to try. Once I started studying this major, I soon realized that computer science was not easy - it felt like learning a completely new language. Sometimes I feel very lost, but my sister is always there to help me. Her guidance has played an important role in helping me overcome challenges

**What I have learned so far**

So far, one of my most unforgettable learning experiences is learning Java. At first, I was confused by the strict syntax and object-oriented programming concepts like classes and inheritance.. Writing code in Java forces me to think carefully and organize my logic more clearly. But as I kept practicing, I began to understand the structure behind it, and I started to appreciate the power and flexibility of this language. Java has laid a solid foundation for me in coding principles and helped me improve my problem-solving skills

**Looking forward**

Looking ahead, I hope to continue to develop on the basis of what I have learned and gain practical experience in software engineering. What I am particularly interested in is understanding how a complete system is constructed - from the front end to the back end - and how different technologies are connected together. I hope to learn software design patterns, testing and version control tools like Git, as well as how to work effectively in a team. My goal is to become a well-rounded software engineer, capable of contributing to meaningful projects and building fully functional and user-friendly software. I'm excited about the journey ahead and look forward to improving my technical skills and teamwork abilities.
