**What about typescript**

Before this module, I had limited exposure to TypeScript, but I quickly began to understand why it’s so widely adopted in modern development. Compared to JavaScript, TypeScript offers more powerful tooling and helps catch errors early through static typing. I’m still not sure if I’ve fully grasped everything, but practicing with it has helped me get more comfortable with how it works. I can see why people use it, and I believe with more practice, it will start to feel more natural.

**WOD?**

To be honest, before taking this course, I had never experienced anything quite like the WODs (Workouts of the Day). The concept really caught my attention because it’s so different from traditional learning methods. I do think it helps make the learning experience more dynamic and engaging. Some of the WODs were quite challenging, especially under time constraints, and at times they could be stressful—particularly when the instructions weren’t entirely clear. Even so, I think those challenges pushed me to think quickly and stay focused, which is a valuable skill. Overall, I believe practicing with WODs is highly beneficial, not only as preparation for interviews but also for working in real-world development teams where things move fast and you need to solve problems under pressure.

**What did I learned**

All in all, this module has helped me grow both technically and mentally. TypeScript taught me how to write more reliable code, and the WODs taught me how to stay sharp under pressure. There’s still plenty for me to learn, but I’m starting to see how these tools and techniques come together to build better software—and better developers.
