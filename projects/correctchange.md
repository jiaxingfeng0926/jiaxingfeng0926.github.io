CorrectChange was one of the first assignment I completed in ICS111. Although it was a simple task, it played an important role in introducing me to the world of programming and Java. This assignment allowed me to personally experience writing code, processing user input, and applying basic logic to solve real-world problems for the first time.

The goal of this program is to prompt the user to input the price of the product and the amount paid. Based on this input, the program calculates and displays the correct changes for US dollars, quarter coins, dime coins, nickel coins, and pence. This is a great practice for understanding conditional sentences, arithmetic operations, and user interaction, all of which are fundamental building blocks in programming.
