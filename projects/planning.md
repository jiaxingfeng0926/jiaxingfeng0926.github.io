summary: "Month-long trip plan across four cities in China, managing logistics and building leadership skills"
---

Last winter break, my friends and I planned a month-long trip across China. As the only Mandarin speaker in the group, I took on the responsibility of organizing the entire journey. We visited four different cities, which meant I had to coordinate transportation, find hotels that accept foreign guests, and create daily itineraries for sightseeing and meals. Beyond planning activities, I also had to make sure everything flowed smoothly so that everyone could enjoy the experience without unnecessary stress.

This experience turned me into a leader. While making practical decisions, I had to balance everyone’s needs and preferences. It strengthened my teamwork skills, since I had to keep everyone engaged and satisfied. It also trained me to think on my feet—whether overcoming language barriers or adjusting plans when things didn’t go as expected. Overall, the trip gave me confidence in handling responsibilities, coordinating logistics, and leading a team through complex situations.
